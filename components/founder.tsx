          <p>
            My path in finance began in traditional banking, where I developed a deep 
            understanding of financial systems and client needs. However, I saw a 
            growing gap between traditional banking practices and the rapid advancement 
            of technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            This observation led me to explore the world of data science, mastering 
            Python, R, and SQL. I realized that by combining my banking expertise 
            with technical skills, I could create solutions that would transform how 
            financial institutions operate and serve their clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through projects like &quot;Predicting Hospital Readmissions&quot; and &quot;Smart 
            Education Systems,&quot; I&apos;ve demonstrated how data science can create impact 
            across various sectors. These experiences shaped my vision for Nebula 
            Analytics - a company that bridges the gap between traditional finance 
            and cutting-edge technology.
